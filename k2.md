##  udev
This udev rule is credited to [Emilio Coppa](https://www.facebook.com/ercoppa) from the [Facebook: Keychron User Group](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=534114427066453&ref=br_rs) and was provided as [GitHub Gist: ercoppa/80-keychron.rules](https://gist.github.com/ercoppa/87a42a5d1fd65539844d7badc276d8e7).

1. Create udev rule `sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/80-keychron.rules`
2. Add the udev rule `SUBSYSTEMS=="input", ATTRS{name}=="Keychron K2", RUN+="echo 0 | tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode"` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/80-keychron.rules`
3. `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`

An alternative solution was offered by [Thạch Nguyễn](https://www.facebook.com/Cobblestone8x). 

1. Set fkeyfirst by:  
  - create  the conf file `sudo touch /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf`. 
  - add this line to the file: `options hid_apple fnmode=2` and save
  - `sudo update-initramfs -u`  
  - `reboot`
2. Use the keyboard in Windows/Android mode

## Numlock
If you get stuck in Numlock mode, double tap F6 to disable it.

## Insert
By default there is no `Insert` key natively on the Keychron K2, though a firmware update is promissed to resolve this in the future. 

This workaround was offered by [Bigheaded Xie](https://www.facebook.com/xieerbigheaded) in the [Facebook: Keychron Linux Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/454178115310062/?ref=group_header)

1. `sudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc`
2. comment out the existing `<DELE>` line and add a replacement
    ```
    // key <DELE> { [ Delete ] };  
    key <DELE> { [ Insert ] }; 
    ```
3. Reboot (potentially `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xbd-data` will avoid the reboot, untested as yet)

## Battery
The battery can report it's state via upower. If your distribution supports this you will be able to get a battery indicator on your desktop. 

To check the keyboard is recognized type:
```
$ upower --dump | grep keyboard -A 7
```

You can get some GUI front-end to reflect the battery status, and different distributions often have them enabled by default. Examples include `gnome-power-statistics`, `mate-power-statistics`, Arch with Gnome has battery reporting working out of the box and in Ubuntu `Settings ⇾ Power` it's also working.

## Caps Lock and Num Lock
The Caps Lock key does not have an indicator at present (though Keychron are investigating a solution via a future firmware update). There is a [Gnome Extension: Lock Keys](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/36/lock-keys/) that will show a Caps Lock and Num Lock indicator on the panel. 

## F Keys on Ubuntu
[Claus Zotter](https://www.facebook.com/claus.zotter) noticed the `F1` ⇾ `F12` keys always act as though `function` key is pressed. 

Edit `etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf` and add the line `options hid_apple fnmode=2` followed by:

```
$ sudo update-initramfs -u && reboot
```

* [Andrii Shkodyn Gist](https://gist.github.com/j2ko/00254950a24498df5902ddc9fceb5ee0) who also notied he does not get a bind action on Ubuntu 16.04 but that it was working as expected on 18.04.

## Keymap
If your Keymap appears to be incorrect make sure that `/sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode` is set to `0` and not `1`.

Method of binding `shift` + `delete` to `insert` suggested by [Konstantinos Liopetas](https://www.facebook.com/konliopetas).
```
$ xmodmap -pke | grep Delete
My Output was:
keycode 91 = KP_Delete KP_Decimal KP_Delete KP_Separator
keycode 119 = Delete NoSymbol Delete NoSymbol Delete
```
So what I did was to add the following line on my `~/.bashrc` (to persist change on reboot)

```
xmodmap -e "keycode 119 = Delete Insert Delete NoSymbol Delete"
```

### Keymap: en-GB (United Kingdom) 
When the keymap is changed to en-GB many characters useful for Linux administration and programming are hard to find. 

The following is a list of the characters I have been able to locate on the changed keymap. The `\ |` describes the  key above enter on the Keychron K2. 
```
# = "\ |" 
\ = AltGr + "\ |"  
~ = Shift + "\ |"
```
I have not located `|`

## Firmware
Keychron are investigating [Linux Vendor Firmware Service](https://fwupd.org/) as a possible solution to delivering firmware on Linux, at present it is only possible to update the firmware via Windows.

## Fast connect bluetooth
For faster reconnect need to set "FastConnectable" to true in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf

## GitLab

[Мухаммад Алифф Муаззам](https://www.facebook.com/Tester2009) also maintains a [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/keychron/k2) that is dedicated to tracking issues with the K2.
